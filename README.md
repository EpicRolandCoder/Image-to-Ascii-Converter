# Image-to-Ascii-Converter
Run the Java file with two arguments. The first argument must be an image (e.g. "example.png") in the same folder as the Java file. The second argument must specify the background colour that the ascii art will be written onto (e.g. "light" OR "dark"), as the background colour will affect the clarity of the Ascii image.
